               <p class="navy">Warning: This story starts off as a sad one, but quickly turns around. In April 2021, I got some scary news about my 11 month old kitten named Sherman. In the few weeks prior, I remember thinking that he seemed so tiny and often lethargic, but I chalked it up to the cold weather in Colorado and the fact that he was still a kitten. On the 20th of April, I noticed more odd behavior - He was bumping into things as he walked throughout our apartment, and when I looked at his eyes, they were completely dilated. I rushed him to the emergency vet to find out what was happening. The vet looked at him immediately determined he was blind. She thought it was strange for this to happen to him at such a young age, so she ran some bloodwork. I knew I was about to receive bad news when the vet came back into the room with teary eyes. She told me that the bloodwork concluded that Sherman had an extremely rare disease called Feline Infectious Peritonitis, or FIP for short. 
                  <a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/feline-infectious-peritonitis">Learn more about FIP here.</a> The vet told me that there was no cure for the disease, and broke the news that Sherman only had a couple more weeks to live. She prescribed me some palliative medicine to make him a little more comfortable, and did not provide any hope that he would get better. Reminder: This story will get better.</p>

               <p class="navy">Naturally, I went straight to Google to learn more about what FIP was. While searching, I came across a Facebook page called FIP Warriors. The group claimed that there was a cure to FIP; however, it was not approved by the FDA. I was extremely skeptical at first and worried it was a scam to take advantage of scared pet parents looking to do anything to make their cats better. But as I did more Google research, I saw more and more articles and stories about GS-441524, a medicine that cures FIP. I decided to give it a try and joined the FIP Warriors Facebook group. After joining the group, I got connected with an FIP Admin through Facebook Messenger who answered all of the questions I had about the medicine. At that point, I figured it was worth a shot and ordered a week’s supply of the medicine. After only two days, I could tell he was getting better. His eyes became less dilated and he started to act more spunky, so I ordered another week’s supply of medicine, and continued to do so for the 12-week treatment plan. Every single day I saw improvement - He had more energy, was eating more, and started to gain weight. Every 30 days of the 12-week treatment plan I took him to the vet for more bloodwork, and each time I did, the results were better and better. </p>

               <p class="navy">It’s now about a year post treatment, and Sherman is living his best life! When I first took him to the emergency vet, he was only 5 pounds and now, he is up to almost 15. This medicine literally saved his life. Interestedly enough, my friend’s brother’s cat had FIP, and because of Sherman’s success, they gave the medicine a try. That cat is now also considered cured of FIP. Whenever I get the opportunity, I share this experience because you never know what other cats and family’s can benefit from it. Thanks for reading!</p>
